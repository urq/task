# same format as taskwarrior
task <filter> <command> <do-something>

# principles:
* you only need to remember things you need to do in context, so only show things that are relevant
* log everything
* notifications, repeated things, and calendar stuff are just an extension of tasks

# commands
add - create new task
modify - change task(s)
show - show the details of the selected tasks
delete - delete tasks
done - complete a task
sync (gcal|jira) [down|up] - use this to sync data with external services
config - use this to set defaults
alias - use this to create shorthands for new filters
ids - prints the ids of the filtered tasks
undo - undo the last action

keep analytics on all usage of this tool for later
